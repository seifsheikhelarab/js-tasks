Waleed has the Imparnumerophobia, which means he fears the odd numbers. Waleed asked you to design a program for him that modifies the strings by replacing any odd number with the word "BEEP". Help him implement this program using your knowledge in regular expressions.

Example:
"I have 12 cars, 11 of which are 89 years old"
Should be
"I have 12 cars, BEEP of which are BEEP years old"
