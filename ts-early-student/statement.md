Write a TypeScript code that creates a class Student that implements the WakesUpEarly interface. The WakesUpEarly interface should have a single method, wakeUpEarly(), which returns a string.

The Student class should implement the wakeUpEarly() method by returning a string that describes how the student wakes up early. For example, the string could say something like "John Doe wakes up early by setting an alarm clock" or "Jane Doe wakes up early because she is a natural early riser."

A Student has a first name, last name and a grade.
