Ahmed landed his first job as a software engineer. The first task given to Ahmed was to implement a chat system.

Ahmed has trouble keeping track of the status of his users. He needs to do the following operations:

- login user with a specific id
- logout user with a specific id
- check if user with a specific id is currently online
- count the number of online users
- count how many times the user id logged in to the system

Can you help Ahmed to implement his first task succefully?

isOnline(id): returns boolean whether user id is currently online or not
countOnline(): returns the number of currently online users
