TypeScript Task

Given an array of ones and zeroes, convert the equivalent binary value to an integer.

Eg: [0, 0, 0, 1] is treated as 0001 which is the binary representation of 1.

Note: Implement it as a TypeScript Function. Make sure the argument array only contains zeroes and ones using type declarations.
